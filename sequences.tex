\section{sequences}

A place for more advanced material on sequences beyond convergence. Can put this after differentiation.

\subsection{Accumulation points}

\subsection{lim sup. lim inf}

Exercise: find a sequence with infinitely many accumulation points. 

Theorem: Accumulation point of accumulation points is an accumulation point.

Cauchy sequences: all Cauchy sequences converge, which is a consequence of least-upper bound property of reals (or can take convergence of Cauchy sequences as axiomatic?)

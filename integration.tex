\section{Integration}
Define integral along same lines as derivative; $f$ is integrable iff the limit of the sequence of Riemann sums exists and is the same for all sequences of partitions with granularity approaching zero. Do not worry about non-continuous functions at all, just prove all continuous functions integrable.

Derivative of integral of $f$ is $f$.

Spivak's definition of $\exp$ goes directly to integral of $1/x$. But if we have already established termwise differentiation of infinite series, then we could show that $y=y'$ is satisfied by sum of $x^n/n!$.

Spivak's definition of integration? integral is common value of sup(lower sums), inf(upper sums)

 Where to put Taylor series? Might be able to avoid them.

\begin{document}
\maketitle
%\section{}
These are notes on how to present the work in progress; notes on pedagogical content are in \texttt{notes.tex}.

Put on 0x0.st or on github; latter is preferable if we can set up ``large file service" for putting images on github; or is there a way to use URLs in place of local file paths for figures? Or set up free wordpress site -- or just send links to dropbox.

Need a semi-clean version for release; okay to have stuff missing but sections that are present need to look ready, i.e. no ``fill this space" notations and enough exercises to be plausible.

Another look at the first batch of exercises -- are they harder than we thought?

Clean up a bit of carelessness about negative angles in the trig section, and give a bit of a hint for how to finish the proof. Would like more exercises!

Need some classic ``graphing $f(x)$" diagrams -- how best to produce them?
